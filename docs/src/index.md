Welcome to the documentation for [MicroTracker.jl](https://github.com/czimm79/MicroTracker.jl)! This is a feature-complete [Julia](https://julialang.org/) package that tracks and analyzes moving [microbots](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-19322-7) in microscopy video. This package tracks critical microbot metrics including size, velocity, and rotation rate. Combined with easy batch processing of videos, MicroTracker enables high-throughput analysis across multiple global experimental variables. For more information on microbots and this package, please see the short [paper](https://github.com/czimm79/MicroTracker.jl/blob/master/paper/paper.md).

## Get Started
Follow an abridged version of the manual with included sample data and videos on the [Quick Start](@ref) page. This page also outlines the layout of the documentation.

## Why Julia?
In short, Julia is easy to read and write, yet retains the speed of statically compiled languages like C and Fortran. It also provides [Pluto.jl](https://github.com/fonsp/Pluto.jl), a reactive notebook environment that enables quick interactivity with zero hidden state. For a more eloquent explanation, see the Julia [introduction](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/).

If you don't know Julia, don't worry. It is similar and as easy as Python (I'd argue easier). The best learning source is the [Computational Thinking](https://computationalthinking.mit.edu/) course from MIT or the included tutorial notebooks in [Pluto.jl](https://github.com/fonsp/Pluto.jl).
