# Experimental

## Setup
A study contains multiple independent variables (temperature, field strength, microbot design, viscosity, geometry). You'll have a separate video for each of these.

An example! Lets say we're studying temperature and field strength. Name your video names accordingly. Talk about file naming formats.

## Crop and clip your video

ImageJ (Fiji) is used to look at microscopy vids

## Segment and make binary through thresholding

Have a macro here to do that:
