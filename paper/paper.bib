Moreover, microrobots were used to transport colorectal carcinoma cancer cells to tumor microtissue in a body-on-a-chip, which comprised an in vitro liver-tumor microorgan network. The microrobots were also controlled in a mouse brain slice and rat brain blood vessel. Last, microrobots carrying mesenchymal stem cells derived from human nose were manipulated inside the intraperitoneal cavity of a nude mouse.

	abstract = {The intravitreal delivery of therapeutic agents promises major benefits in the field of ocular medicine. Traditional delivery methods rely on the random, passive diffusion of molecules, which do not allow for the rapid delivery of a concentrated cargo to a defined region at the posterior pole of the eye. The use of particles promises targeted delivery but faces the challenge that most tissues including the vitreous have a tight macromolecular matrix that acts as a barrier and prevents its penetration. Here, we demonstrate novel intravitreal delivery microvehicles—slippery micropropellers—that can be actively propelled through the vitreous humor to reach the retina. The propulsion is achieved by helical magnetic micropropellers that have a liquid layer coating to minimize adhesion to the surrounding biopolymeric network. The submicrometer diameter of the propellers enables the penetration of the biopolymeric network and the propulsion through the porcine vitreous body of the eye over centimeter distances. Clinical optical coherence tomography is used to monitor the movement of the propellers and confirm their arrival on the retina near the optic disc. Overcoming the adhesion forces and actively navigating a swarm of micropropellers in the dense vitreous humor promise practical applications in ophthalmology.},

	abstract = {Mobile microrobots offer great promise for minimally invasive targeted medical theranostic applications at hard-to-access regions inside the human body. The circulatory system represents the ideal route for navigation; however, blood flow impairs propulsion of microrobots especially for the ones with overall sizes less than 10 micrometers. Moreover, cell- and tissue-specific targeting is required for efficient recognition of disease sites and long-term preservation of microrobots under dynamic flow conditions. Here, we report cell-sized multifunctional surface microrollers with {\textasciitilde}3.0 and {\textasciitilde}7.8-micrometer diameters, inspired by leukocytes in the circulatory system, for targeted drug delivery into specific cells and controlled navigation inside blood flow. The leukocyte-inspired spherical microrollers are composed of magnetically responsive Janus microparticles functionalized with targeting antibodies against cancer cells (anti-HER2) and light-cleavable cancer drug molecules (doxorubicin). Magnetic propulsion and steering of the microrollers resulted in translational motion speeds up to 600 micrometers per second, around 76 body lengths per second. Targeting cancer cells among a heterogeneous cell population was demonstrated by active propulsion and steering of the microrollers over the cell monolayers. The multifunctional microrollers were propelled against physiologically relevant blood flow (up to 2.5 dynes per square centimeter) on planar and endothelialized microchannels. Furthermore, the microrollers generated sufficient upstream propulsion to locomote on inclined three-dimensional surfaces in physiologically relevant blood flow. The multifunctional microroller platform described here presents a bioinspired approach toward in vivo controlled propulsion, navigation, and targeted active cargo delivery in the circulatory system.},

            Microscale bots intended for targeted drug delivery must move through three-dimensional (3D) environments that include bifurcations, inclined surfaces, and curvature. In previous studies, we have shown that magnetically actuated colloidal microwheels (µwheels) reversibly assembled from superparamagnetic beads can translate rapidly and be readily directed. Here we show that, at high concentrations, µwheels assemble into swarms that, depending on applied magnetic field actuation patterns, can be designed to transport cargo, climb steep inclines, spread over large areas, or provide mechanical action. We test the ability of these multimodal swarms to navigate through complex, inclined microenvironments by characterizing the translation and dispersion of individual µwheels and swarms of µwheels on steeply inclined and flat surfaces. Swarms are then studied within branching 3D vascular models with multiple turns where good targeting efficiencies are achieved over centimeter length scales. With this approach, we present a readily reconfigurable swarm platform capable of navigating through 3D microenvironments.},

To uncouple size from structure and function, here we demonstrate an approach where individual building blocks are aerosolized and subsequently assembled in situ into μbots capable of translation, drug delivery, and mechanical work deep within lung mimics. With this strategy, a variety of pulmonary diseases previously difficult to treat may now be receptive to μbot-based therapies.},

	abstract = {Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is mediated by an overexpression of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF) by mononuclear cells in the intestinal mucosa. Intravenous delivery of neutralizing anti-TNF antibodies can cause systemic immunosuppression, and up to one-third of people are nonresponsive to treatment. Oral delivery of anti-TNF could reduce adverse effects; however, it is hampered by antibody degradation in the harsh gut environment during transit and poor bioavailability. To overcome these shortcomings, we demonstrate magnetically powered hydrogel particles that roll along mucosal surfaces, provide protection from degradation, and sustain the local release of anti-TNF. Iron oxide particles are embedded into a cross-linked chitosan hydrogel and sieved to produce 100−200 μm particles called milliwheels (m-wheels). Once loaded with anti-TNF, these m-wheels release 10 to 80\% of their payload over 1 week at a rate that depends on the cross-linking density and pH. A rotating magnetic field induces a torque on the m-wheels that results in rolling velocities greater than 500 μm/s on glass and mucus-secreting cells. The permeability of the TNF-challenged gut epithelial cell monolayers was rescued in the presence of anti-TNF carrying m-wheels, which both neutralized the TNF and created an impermeable patch over leaky cell junctions. With the ability to translate over mucosal surfaces at high speed, provide sustained release directly to the inflamed epithelium, and provide barrier rescue, m-wheels demonstrate a potential strategy to deliver therapeutic proteins for the treatment of IBD.},

It is also easily scriptable and adaptable, operating equally well on 1D over time, 2D over time, 3D over time, or other single and multi-channel image variants. TrackMate provides several visualization and analysis tools that aid in assessing the relevance of results. The utility of TrackMate is further enhanced through its ability to be readily customized to meet specific tracking problems. TrackMate is an extensible platform where developers can easily write their own detection, particle linking, visualization or analysis algorithms within the TrackMate environment. This evolving framework provides researchers with the opportunity to quickly develop and optimize new algorithms based on existing TrackMate modules without the need of having to write de novo user interfaces, including visualization, analysis and exporting tools. The current capabilities of TrackMate are presented in the context of three different biological problems. First, we perform Caenorhabditis-elegans lineage analysis to assess how light-induced damage during imaging impairs its early development. Our TrackMate-based lineage analysis indicates the lack of a cell-specific light-sensitive mechanism. Second, we investigate the recruitment of NEMO (NF-κB essential modulator) clusters in fibroblasts after stimulation by the cytokine IL-1 and show that photodamage can generate artifacts in the shape of TrackMate characterized movements that confuse motility analysis. Finally, we validate the use of TrackMate for quantitative lifetime analysis of clathrin-mediated endocytosis in plant cells.},

Using this technique, we have previously demonstrated that superparamagnetic colloidal particles can be assembled into small μbots, which can quickly roll along solid surfaces. In an analogous approach, here we show that symmetry can be similarly broken near air/liquid interfaces and μbots propelled at rates comparable to those demonstrated for liquid/solid interfaces.},

From the solution of this equation the co-efficients of the difference (or differential) equation of the optimal linear filter are obtained without further calculations. (3) The filtering problem is shown to be the dual of the noise-free regulator problem. The new method developed here is applied to two well-known problems, confirming and extending earlier results. The discussion is largely self-contained and proceeds from first principles; basic concepts of the theory of random processes are reviewed in the Appendix.}",
